Overall Goal: We are working on creating a new syllabic alphabet adapted to most Indo-European languages, using SVG code to represent the symbols. 
The alphabet will consist of base symbols for consonants and vowels, derived symbols for syllables, symbols for phonetic variations, and punctuation marks. 
The symbols will follow a consistent method for deriving syllables from base consonant symbols by adding corresponding vowel symbols as modifiers. 
Each symbol will be accompanied by a unique name, description, corresponding representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), equivalent sounds in at least one representative of each major family of Indo-European languages (including languages with different scripts), and a description of how to write the symbol in English. 
The symbols will be as simple as possible in their shapes. The symbols will be stored as separate SVG files and their metadata in a JSON file.

Alphabet:

Base consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, m, n, ŋ, f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, x, ɣ, h, tʃ, dʒ, l, r, j, w
Base vowels: i, e, ɛ, y, ə, u, o, ɔ, a
Additional symbols for specific phonetic variations and language-specific sounds will be created as needed.
Punctuation marks will be included as well.
Rules:

Each symbol will be created using SVG code, with a simple and easy-to-write design.
The alphabet will be syllabic, with consonants and vowels combined to form syllables.
The method for deriving syllables will be consistent, adding corresponding vowel symbols as modifiers to the base consonant symbols.
Each symbol will have a unique name, description, IPA representation, and examples in various Indo-European languages.
The alphabet will cover major families of Indo-European languages, including languages with different scripts.
A description of how to write the symbol in English will be included for each symbol.
Use this compact representation and the rules as a reference while generating the alphabet to ensure you cover all the required symbols and follow the defined rules.


Task 1: Generate base consonant symbols using SVG code for the following consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, m, n, ŋ, f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, x, ɣ, h, tʃ, dʒ, l, r, j, w. Include a unique name, description, corresponding IPA representation, equivalent sounds in various Indo-European languages, and a description of how to write the symbol in English for each symbol. Save the SVG files in the 'svg' folder and update the 'symbols_data.json' file in the 'json' folder with the symbol metadata.
